# **AAF INSPECTABLE 1.0**

## Purpose of this License

This license is crafted for such cases in which the integrity, authenticity or identity of the source must be preserved by locking or preventing all public contributions to the source, while the transparency of the services/products offered by the owner/author should still be valid. The public can inspect freely, they cannot make changes. The Source must be made available free-of-cost and the public can verify if the product is derived from the source or not.

## **How to License?**
In order to validly license your Product under this license, you MUST do the following:

Include the statement 
```
<PRODUCT NAME> is licensed under AAF INSPECTABLE 1.0 License on <EXPANDED DATE>. Copyright Â© <AUTHOR NAME> All rights reserved.
```
in the product, with links to the Source and the License.

``
<PRODUCT NAME> - Name of the Product
or you can just insert "This Software/Application/Product..." (whichever applies)
``

``
<EXPANDED DATE> - The Expanded form of the Date on which you make the Source or Product available, whichever comes first.
``

``
<AUTHOR NAME> - Your name. It could be the name of a person, a group of people, an organisation, an entity... The entity that is responsible for, and owns/maintains the source and the product.
``

**You SHOULD also provide the Human Readable Summary of this License along with the Source/Source Code to make this License valid for the product. The summary file accompanying the Source is usually named LICENSE, and we recommend using that name for clarity and consistency.**

## **Terms & Conditions**

- ***Disclaimer***: The source and the product derived/built from the source, is provided as is, without any warranty. The Author/Owner of the source and product does not guarantee that the source/product will work as intended. The applicability of the source/product may or may not depend on the use case or scenario.
- ***Privileges***: You CAN freely inspect the Code/Source/Source Code, made available under this License. You are allowed to "build" (as in convert from Source to Product) the Source and verify that the Product offered by the Author is derived from the Source. If at any point, the built Source does not give a result identical to the Product (as in the services included in the product and not any Verification, Login, Credential, Authorization, API keys, Privacy related material included in the product), you can report it to the appropriate authorities by means of images/multimedia.
- ***Restrictions***: You are NOT allowed to modify, alter, build upon, redesign, rebrand, redistribute or make any sort of changes to the Source. You are NOT allowed to distribute or redistribute, sell or make available, the Product and the result of the "build" of the Source.
- ***Source Availability***: The Owner/Author has the obligation to provide the Source to the public free-of-cost, once the product is made available. The Author may make the Source available for inspection before the product is available to the public. However, making source available before the product is not necessary under the terms of this license. The Owner/Author is allowed to take any necessary actions to prevent the public from redistributing, reselling or rebranding the source, the product, or the "build result" of the source.
- ***What is Source?*** This license clearly distinguishes the Source from the Product. The Source is that part, from which the Product is derived. If the process of building/creating the product includes references to external sources or code or content, those materials will not be part of the Source and those parts will individually hold licenses as mentioned by the owners and authors of the respective parts (This usually refers to Libraries, Extensions, Plugins... that is used to expand the functinality of a software/product). If the source/product has multiple authors/owners, then all authors/owners must consent to make the Source and the Product available under this license.
- ***Product Price***: This license can be used for products that are sold, or are offered in return of profit. The product DOES NOT have to be provided free of cost to the user.
- ***Illegal/Immoral use***: This license cannot be used for sources/products that are built/designed for illegal/immoral activities. This license also prevents all users from using the Source/Products to commit, perform or support any illegal/immoral activities.
- *This license is subject to invalidity in the case of violation of the terms and conditions by the Author/Owner. The terms of use of the source/product in such a case will be subject to the copyright law applicable in the jurisdiction that the author/owner belongs to. In such a case, the users cannot be accounted for violation of terms and conditions of THIS license. And the users will get any legal benefit from the fact that the Author/Owner violated the terms and conditions of this license, according to the applicable laws. Any further clarification is in the hands of the legal institution and jurisdiction that the User and the Author/Owner belongs to.*

## Common Applications

This license typically can be used for Software and Software related services, where there is a clear distinction between the Source and the Product. This license can also be used for Movies, Films, Short Films, Documentaries, Videos where these are *Products* and the Script/Story is the *Source*. This can be used for any other purpose, wherever the distinction between the Source and the Product is valid.

## Migration

If at any point, the Owner/Author intends to change the licensing terms of the product/source, the migration (change in license) can only happen in the following way:
- The product/source can be newly licensed, given that the newly licensed product/source is released/made available as a new version. The licenses of the previous versions cannot be changed.
- Migration is invalid if the Source and the Product cannot be released as a new version.
