## **Shared Source**

The traditional definition of open source is flawed, as it is often meant to be "Free and Open Source" instead of just "Open Source". And because of that, this licence is not compatible with the definition of Open Source by the Open Source Initiative (OSI). Instead this licence follows the true meaning of open source, allowing the source to be inspected and verified by the 
public free of cost. However, advertising that this licence is an Open Source licence can lead to ambiguity and confusion. Hence we choose to identify this licence as belonging to the "Shared Source" family of licences.
